# iOS-Portfolio-Ahmed22


Hello! My name is Bilal Ahmed, a junior in high school, and this is my portfolio to showcase all the projects I have worked on thus far. Ever since I was a kid I have been fascinated with the hardware side of things; never programming. I always felt programming to be boring, however that changed when I took my first programming class in High School, AP CSP. In that class, I learned what programming is, and block-coded up a few cool apps. Although this was block coding it helped me realize how important programming can be. This then lead me to take AP Java in which I learned java, a shocker. This was a tough leap from block coding to writing actual lines of code, but I eventually got the hang of it. Over the summer I delved deeper into java and learned more complex topics like importing data, implementation, and APIS. Additionally, I also learned python; for the sole purpose of automating boring daily tasks. Currently, I am taking IOS and working on EPHS Timer and OpenVote

**Below are my best projects in each language; java, python, and swift**


## Python
### [Dinsey+](https://github.com/BillA-Dev/Disney-)
This is the first python project I created that involved a GUI; a disney+ movie picker. I had always been the indecisive type of person; I could never choose the right move, so that's why I created this app. This app has saved me minutes of just pointless searching. This app was beneficial to make because I learned about UI--PYQT-- and how to use an API.

### [PYQT to python code](https://github.com/BillA-Dev/PYQT_to_Python)
This is the second big python project that I created. I created this app to help save time when translating pyQT UI to Python code. Without the app, you have to use the terminal, and move files which is tedious, especially on a timeline. This project allowed me to learn how to call command lines in python code as well as threads.

### [Vector Calculator](https://github.com/BillA-Dev/VectorAddition/blob/main/main.py)
This is my last significant python project. The purpose of this app was to help me with my physics homework. There were not a lot of graphing resources online, and I didnt know if I was doing it correctly. This app takes the magnitude and angle and graphs them in a neat format. This project allowed me to learn about math functions in python and how to use mathplotlib

## Java
### [Password Generator](https://github.com/BillA-Dev/PasswordGenerator)
This was my first advanced java project because it involved the use of GUI components. Creating GUI is difficult in java but Eclipse has a nice plug-in that allows you to drag and drop. The purpose of the app was to create strong passwords on the go. This is helpful if you cant think of passwords or are in a rush. The project allowed me to learn about GUI components in java.

### Cashier 
*I will not be linking a repo, this has sensitive personal information regarding database and passwords*

This is another project I made that doesn't have a real purpose. The reason I created this app was to test MySQL databases, which I have been interested in for a while. This app allowed me to learn how to connect java to MySQL and learn how MySQL data is stored.

### [Directory Watcher](https://github.com/BillA-Dev/DirectoryWatcher)
This is my last java project and was by far the hardest. This project challenged me in many ways. For instance, I had to learn about how directories work, how to watch a directory constantly, transfer data between classes, saving choices. The intended purpose of the app was to clear the clutter in your directory. To illustrate, if you chose your download folder to be your watched directory the program would find the selected file endings and move them accordingly.

## Swift
### [EPHS Timer App](https://github.com/BillA-Dev/EPHS)
The EPHS timer app was the first swift project I worked on. This was a steep learning curve as swift was not something I was used to. I thought of swift as a blend of java and python; could not quite wrap my brain around it. After a while, I eventually got it to work and had a lot of fun developing the app. This project is still ongoing but I learned how swiftUI works and cloudKit

### [OpenVote](https://github.com/BillA-Dev/OpenVote)
