# iOS-Portfolio-Ahmed22


Hello! My name is Bilal Ahmed and I am a senior in high school. This portfolio showcases the projects I have worked on so far in my journey as a developer. Growing up, I always had a fascination with hardware, but programming seemed boring to me. That all changed when I took my first programming class in high school, AP CSP. In that class, I discovered the power and potential of programming and even created a few apps using block coding. Motivated to continue learning, I took AP Java and was introduced to the world of writing actual lines of code. It was a challenging transition, but I persevered and learned more advanced concepts such as data importing, implementation, and APIs. I also taught myself Python, which I use to automate mundane tasks. Since then, I have taken IOS courses and worked on developing two exciting projects: EPHS Timer and OpenVote. Thank you for visiting my portfolio and I hope you enjoy exploring my work.


**Below are my best projects in each language: java, python, and swift**


## Python
### [Disney+](https://github.com/BillA-Dev/Disney-)
I am excited to share my first Python project involving a GUI with you: a Disney+ movie picker app. As someone who has always struggled with indecisiveness, I created this app to save myself the time and frustration of endless searching for the perfect movie to watch. In the process of building this app, I learned about UI design using PYQT and how to utilize APIs. Not only has this app been a huge time-saver for me, but it has also been a valuable learning experience.

### [PYQT to python code](https://github.com/BillA-Dev/PYQT_to_Python)
This is my second major Python project: an app designed to streamline the process of translating PYQT UI to Python code. Normally, to translate the UI one would have to use the terminal and manually move files: a tedious and time-consuming task, especially when working on a tight timeline. This app was designed to address that issue, and in the process of building it, I learned how to call command lines in Python code and work with threads.

### [Vector Calculator](https://github.com/BillA-Dev/VectorAddition/blob/main/main.py)
I am excited to share my final significant Python project with you: a physics helper app. As a student, I discovered that there were not as many online resources available for graphing vectors, and I was often unsure if I was doing my homework correctly. This app was created to address that issue by taking the magnitude and angle of a given problem and graphing it in a clear and organized format. In the process of building this app, I learned about math functions in Python and how to use mathplotlib.

## Java
### [Password Generator](https://github.com/BillA-Dev/PasswordGenerator)
This was my first advanced Java project, which involved the use of GUI components. Creating GUI by using pure code can be challenging in Java, but I found that Eclipse has a convenient plug-in that allows you to easily drag and drop elements. The purpose of this app was to generate strong passwords on the go, which can be especially helpful if you're struggling to come up with a good password. While building this app, I learned about working with GUI components in Java, and the basics of password security.

### Cashier 
*I will not be linking a repo, this has sensitive personal information regarding database and passwords*

This is the second project that I created in order to explore and test the capabilities of MySQL databases, a technology that has long piqued my interest but was always too afraid to delve into. Through this project, I was able to learn how to connect Java to MySQL and gain an understanding of how MySQL data is stored and organized. While this app may not have a specific practical purpose, it has been a valuable learning experience for me and has further fueled my interest in database technology

### [Directory Watcher](https://github.com/BillA-Dev/DirectoryWatcher)
This is my last final Java project, one that has been the most challenging one to date. This project pushed me in many ways, requiring me to learn about how directories work, how to constantly watch a directory, and how to transfer data between classes and save user choices. The intended purpose of this app is to declutter a selected directory by finding files with certain endings and moving them to designated locations. This project has been a true test of my skills and has allowed me to expand my knowledge and understanding of the Java programming language.

## Swift
### [EPHS Timer App](https://github.com/BillA-Dev/EPHS)
The EPHS timer app was my first touch into the world of Swift programming, and it was certainly a steep learning curve for me. As someone who was more familiar with Java and Python, I initially found it challenging to wrap my head around the unique syntax and concepts of Swift. However, with time, I was able to understand the language and get a prototype of the app up and running. This project is still ongoing, and through it, I have gained a deeper understanding of how SwiftUI works and how to use CloudKit. Overall, this has been a challenging but rewarding project for me.

### [OpenVote](https://github.com/BillA-Dev/OpenVote)
OpenVote is a project dedicated to increasing transparency in American political spending, allowing voters to hold their elected officials accountable. Special interest money is at the heart of our government's dysfunction â€” it often dictates what issues are addressed and who benefits from Congress's solutions. But it doesn't have to be that way.

### [PostItApp](https://github.com/EPHS-iOS/Spring2022GroupProject)
Each semester, students in AP CSP create post-it note art around the high school. To encourage other students to find the art around the school, students in iOS created this app. With the PostItApp, users can take pictures of the art around the school and the app will reconize the image, giving users point for each image. The leaderboard shows the users with themost points.
