# iOS-Portfolio-Ahmed22


Hello! My name is Bilal Ahmed and I am a senior in high school. This portfolio showcases the projects I have worked on so far in my journey as a developer. Growing up, I always had a fascination with hardware, but programming seemed boring to me. That all changed when I took my first programming class in high school, AP CSP. In that class, I discovered the power and potential of programming and even created a few apps using block coding. Motivated to continue learning, I took AP Java and was introduced to the world of writing actual lines of code. It was a challenging transition, but I persevered and learned more advanced concepts such as data importing, implementation, and APIs. I also taught myself Python, which I use to automate mundane tasks. Since then, I have taken IOS courses and worked on developing two exciting projects: EPHS Timer and OpenVote. Thank you for visiting my portfolio and I hope you enjoy exploring my work.


**Below are my best projects in each language: java, python, and swift**


## Python
### [Disney+](https://github.com/BillA-Dev/Disney-)
I am excited to share my first Python project involving a GUI with you: a Disney+ movie picker app. As someone who has always struggled with indecisiveness, I created this app to save myself the time and frustration of endless searching for the perfect movie to watch. In the process of building this app, I learned about UI design using PYQT and how to utilize APIs. Not only has this app been a huge time-saver for me, but it has also been a valuable learning experience.

### [PYQT to python code](https://github.com/BillA-Dev/PYQT_to_Python)
This is my second major Python project: an app designed to streamline the process of translating PYQT UI to Python code. Normally, to translate the UI one would have to use the terminal and manually move files: a tedious and time-consuming task, especially when working on a tight timeline. This app was designed to address that issue, and in the process of building it, I learned how to call command lines in Python code and work with threads.

### [Vector Calculator](https://github.com/BillA-Dev/VectorAddition/blob/main/main.py)
This is my last significant python project. The purpose of this app was to help me with my physics homework. There were not a lot of graphing resources online, and I didnt know if I was doing it correctly. This app takes the magnitude and angle and graphs them in a neat format. This project allowed me to learn about math functions in python and how to use mathplotlib

## Java
### [Password Generator](https://github.com/BillA-Dev/PasswordGenerator)
This was my first advanced java project because it involved the use of GUI components. Creating GUI is difficult in java but Eclipse has a nice plug-in that allows you to drag and drop. The purpose of the app was to create strong passwords on the go. This is helpful if you cant think of passwords or are in a rush. The project allowed me to learn about GUI components in java.

### Cashier 
*I will not be linking a repo, this has sensitive personal information regarding database and passwords*

This is another project I made that doesn't have a real purpose. The reason I created this app was to test MySQL databases, which I have been interested in for a while. This app allowed me to learn how to connect java to MySQL and learn how MySQL data is stored.

### [Directory Watcher](https://github.com/BillA-Dev/DirectoryWatcher)
This is my last java project and was by far the hardest. This project challenged me in many ways. For instance, I had to learn about how directories work, how to watch a directory constantly, transfer data between classes, saving choices. The intended purpose of the app was to clear the clutter in your directory. To illustrate, if you chose your download folder to be your watched directory the program would find the selected file endings and move them accordingly.

## Swift
### [EPHS Timer App](https://github.com/BillA-Dev/EPHS)
The EPHS timer app was the first swift project I worked on. This was a steep learning curve as swift was not something I was used to. I thought of swift as a blend of java and python; could not quite wrap my brain around it. After a while, I eventually got it to work and had a lot of fun developing the app. This project is still ongoing but I learned how swiftUI works and cloudKit

### [OpenVote](https://github.com/BillA-Dev/OpenVote)
OpenVote is a project dedicated to increasing transparency in American political spending, allowing voters to hold their elected officials accountable. Special interest money is at the heart of our government's dysfunction â€” it often dictates what issues are addressed and who benefits from Congress's solutions. But it doesn't have to be that way.

### [PostItApp](https://github.com/EPHS-iOS/Spring2022GroupProject)
Each semester, students in AP CSP create post-it note art around the high school. To encourage other students to find the art around the school, students in iOS created this app. With the PostItApp, users can take pictures of the art around the school and the app will reconize the image, giving users point for each image. The leaderboard shows the users with themost points.
