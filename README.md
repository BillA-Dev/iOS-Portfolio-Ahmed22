# iOS-Portfolio-Ahmed22


Hello, My name is Bilal Ahmed, a junior in high school, and this is my portfolio to showcase all my projects I have worked on thus far. Eversince I was a kid I have been fascinated with programming and computers. Whenever I would come home from school, I would mess around on my home pc; a stress releiver. Although, I liked programming I never fully commited to learning a language. I would get bored really fast; I always wanted to accomplsih more than what I could. 

I first got into programming in APCSP where we learned to block code. I was fascinated by the inner workings and what you could accomplish. This led me to taking AP java where I learned the basics and got a decent understanding of the programming language. Then over the summer I delved deeper into java and learned python. I used python to automate, and run task that I would do daily


## Python
### Dinsey+
This is my first python project I created; a disney+ movie picker. The purpose behind this app was to help my indescivness and save time. This app allowed me to learn about UI--PYQT-- and how to use an API.

### PYQT to python code
This is the second big python project that I created. The puprose behind this was to save time from trasnfering QTcreator design to Python code. This prject alllowed me learn about calling command line in python code, as well as threads.

### Vector Calculator
This last python project was the hardest of them all. I prgrammed this app to help me with my physics homework; to tell me wether my graphs are right or not. This project allwoed me to learn about math functions in swift and math plot lib
