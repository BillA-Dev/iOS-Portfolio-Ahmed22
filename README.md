# iOS-Portfolio-Ahmed22


Hello, My name is Bilal Ahmed, a junior in high school, and this is my portfolio to showcase all my projects I have worked on thus far. Eversince I was a kid I have been fascinated with programming and computers. Whenever I would come home from school, I would mess around on my home pc; a stress releiver. Although, I liked programming I never fully commited to learning a language. I would get bored really fast; I always wanted to accomplsih more than what I could. 

I first got into programming in APCSP where we learned to block code. I was fascinated by the inner workings and what you could accomplish. This led me to taking AP java where I learned the basics and got a decent understanding of the programming language. Then over the summer I delved deeper into java and learned python. I used python to automate, and run task that I would do daily


## Python
This is my first python project I created; a disney+ movie picker. The purpose behind this app was to help my indescivness and save time. This app allowed me to learn about UI--PYQT-- and how to use an API.
